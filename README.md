# Introduction
This camera platform mainly consists of two 180-degree servos, a WIFI camera, and an acrylic platform holder. As long as you have the ability to drive two 5v servos and a WIFI camera serial port, you can use this camera platform. It is a DIY product that supports a variety of expansion boards or expanded DIY circuits by yourself.
